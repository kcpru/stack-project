# Stack Data Structure Handling

This repository contains the code for the project developed in C as part of the "*JÄ™zyki i paradygmaty programowania*" course at the university.

## Description

The project focuses on implementing a stack data structure and utilizing it to manage student records. The program allows users to perform various operations on the stack, including adding a student, removing a student, finding a student, printing the stack contents, saving the stack to a file, and loading the stack from a file.

## Usage

To use the program, you will need to have **Visual Studio 2022** installed on your computer. Follow these steps to run the program:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in **Visual Studio 2022**.
3.  Build the project to compile the code.
4.  Run the program from within Visual Studio or locate the compiled executable file and run it.

Follow the on-screen menu prompts to interact with the program and perform different operations on the stack.

## Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

- `main.c`: Contains the main entry point of the program.
- `data.h` and `data.c`: Define and implement the student data structure and related functions.
- `stack.h` and `stack.c`: Define and implement the stack data structure and related functions.
- `error.h` and `error.c`: Define and handle error messages.
- `interface.h` and `interface.c`: Define and display the user interface menu.
